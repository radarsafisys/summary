Radar-Safi Systems: Proposal for ICT Integration

Prepared by Henry N. Kaosa, JKUAT Research Technologist

Date: June 30, 2025
Overview

Radar-Safi is an AI-powered platform developed to enhance agricultural logistics and nutrition in Kenya. Blending “Radar” (situational awareness) with “Safi” (purity/excellence in Kiswahili), it connects farmers, transporters, and health data to boost food security and rural economies.
Key Features

    GPS Tracking: Maps farmer locations (e.g., Nandi, Nyamira) and optimizes transporter routes.
    Nutritional Integration: Links health data to suggest crops, addressing deficiencies (e.g., Vitamin A in Chepterit).
    Operator Dashboard: Manages cargo pickups and deliveries with M-Pesa payment simulation.
    Scalable Tech: Built with Google Maps API and AI, pilot-ready for 20-30 farmers.

Impact

    Farmers: 20-30 registered in pilot, with potential to save 50+ tons of produce annually.
    Nutrition: Targets malnutrition in 2-3 regions, improving public health outcomes.
    Economy: Engages 5-10 transporters, reducing costs by 10-15% per trip.
    National Alignment: Supports Vision 2030’s food security and digital economy goals.

Proposed Pilot

    Location: Nandi and Nyamira Counties.
    Duration: 3 months (July-September 2025).
    Support Needed: ICT Ministry backing for API costs, integration with e-Citizen, or Konza hub testing.
    Next Steps: Demo with CS Kabogo, followed by stakeholder rollout.
